[00:00.01] In the interview, Cathie Wood discusses the successful launch of ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, noting they are punching above their weight in volume against giants like Fidelity, whereas ARK’s flows are mainly retail.
[00:12.94] Answering what sets ARK apart, she cites a plethora of experience, deep research, and a battle-tested infrastructure developed with 21 Shares.
[00:22.14] Another key variable is their dedicated sales team, which educates advisors on Bitcoin, which she calls the financial superhighway.
[00:30.55] She recounts her first encounter with Bitcoin, when analysts would bring provocative and controversial ideas to brainstorms.
[00:37.47] This led to a breakthrough in their thinking, with their chief futurist and crypto analyst falling down the rabbit hole, becoming obsessed with its potential for commerce and removing middlemen.
[00:48.78] Wood frames this as a new industrial revolution, driven by disruptive technologies similar to the internal combustion engine.
[00:56.54] She believes we are entering a period of exponential growth driven by various technology platforms and their subsets, an idea many find odd.
[01:05.60] She highlights the convergence of AI and Bitcoin, which she discussed at a brainstorm in Tennessee.
[01:19.03] While it’s hard to comprehend all future jobs, new roles will emerge requiring workers to be linguistically precise.
[01:24.79] She uses drones and educational seminars as examples of new opportunities.
[01:35.41] This tremendous disruption threatens legacy industries, which is why Jamie Dimon is so vociferous in his opposition, fearing new financial rails will derail his business.
[01:42.49] Discussing firms like Vanguard blocking the ETFs, Wood says being on good terms with the SEC is vital.
[01:48.30] The ETFs were only approved because the judicial branch prevented the movement from being derailed.
[01:56.73] She calls Merrill Lynch conservative but believes they won't want to fall into the same trap as Vanguard, as their role is to facilitate access for clients.
[02:08.19] This pressure is fueled by crowdsourcing and what the "Fat Protocol" thesis, born from a venture fund, describes: value accruing to the base layer, as opposed to applications on top.
[02:12.10] She believes we're at a tipping point where people are apt to learn more.
[02:21.46] Bitcoin is a unique monetary asset that started taking off while regional banks were imploding because it has no counterparty risk, so you can't be held hostage.
[02:24.73] She enjoys contrasting it with the traditional system.
[02:31.82] The Lightning Network is making great strides, enabling giga work and putting emerging market adoption on steroids.
[02:46.40] She cites famed economist and monetary scholar Art Laffer, who believes that once Bitcoin has proliferated and become fairly ubiquitous, its massive utility will make it a stable means of exchange, not just a volatile asset that goes straight up.
[02:56.79] Bitcoin could discipline central banks and dominate alongside the dollar, but she rejects CBDCs as tools for surveillance and an invasion of privacy.
[03:00.30] She sees stablecoins as key for interoperability.
[03:06.07] Looking ahead, Wood predicts the Fed will begin easing due to deflation, not just disinflation.
[03:14.88] With inflation as the primary gauge and variable they watch, rate cuts will boost risk assets, and Bitcoin’s scarcity value will become apparent.
[03:19.37] On an Ethereum ETF, she notes many have thrown their hat in the ring.
[03:29.90] She believes SEC Chair Gensler has political aspirations and might drag his feet, but the Coinbase trial and the Ripple ruling, which set great precedents, will force the issue.
[03:33.00] This will lead to clear legislative oversight.
[03:37.72] Congress is coming up the learning curve, and she thinks the odds of legislation are high.
[03:42.16] As politicians learn about immutable digital rights, they will come around.
[03:49.16] She sees industry powerhouses like Larry Fink taking an offensive, not defensive, stance on tokenization.
[03:55.28] Her final advice to investors: don’t diversify away from a big idea if you have strong conviction.
