[00:00.01]In the interview, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce discusses upcoming changes at the agency, especially regarding pro-crypto initiatives.
[00:09.13] She expresses great admiration for incoming Chair Paul Atkins, noting his deep understanding of how markets and regulation interact.
[00:18.58] She highlights his method of viewing potential unintended consequences through both an economics lens and a practical lens, stating she learned a tremendous amount from him and that he will make the agency more nimble.
[00:31.52] Peirce believes Atkins will take a proactive approach, which is needed as the agency has not acquitted itself well with crypto.
[00:39.16] She says he can diagnose the problems and provide clarity, including on what falls outside the SEC’s remit.
[00:46.37] A key challenge the SEC must carve out is defining its jurisdiction to foster innovation from new entrants rather than just protecting incumbents.
[00:55.93] His experience with the equities market is seen as a plus.
[00:59.27] Addressing the SEC's reputational damage, Tony Edward uses the verbiage "repair" and gives anecdotal evidence of public frustration.
[01:08.36] Peirce agrees they must address that problem, which has been taken over by a negative approach, especially with respect to crypto.
[01:15.87] She states that providing regulatory clarity through incremental steps is the solution.
[01:21.05] Change will come from at the top, as the agency's civil servants follow the commission's direction.
[01:27.25] When Tony is spitballing ideas for easier registration, like a dedicated crypto subdivision, Peirce explains it's more complex.
[01:35.77] A project must line up with existing rules and precedent.
[01:39.60] She suggests pathways like exemptive relief, an innovation sandbox, or a safe harbor proposal where firms might be exempt or only need to comply with certain rules.
[01:50.51] She emphasizes wanting concrete results.
[01:53.98] The SEC has sophisticated tools and should use them where appropriate.
[01:58.14] On working with Congress, Peirce says the SEC can advise on rulemaking and help a new digital asset subcommittee.
[02:05.64] The agency's work can shed light on where its statutory authority ends, making it apparent where legislative action is needed.
[02:13.47] A new tone is expected.
[02:15.35] Peirce is against using litigation and enforcement to set policy, as settlements in non-fraud cases become a de facto rule.
[02:23.57] Regarding future altcoin ETFs, Peirce states each application requires justification.
[02:29.77] She wants to be consistent and apply the same rationale used for other products.
[02:34.92] Finally, as they wrap up, she clarifies her tenure ends in 2025 and repeats her desire for the industry to bring concrete ideas, as she intends to continue working on these issues.
